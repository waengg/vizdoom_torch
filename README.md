# ViZDoom using PyTorch

Implementations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods using the ViZDoom environment as a testbed. More specifically, this project focuses on the development of the [Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction](https://pathak22.github.io/noreward-rl/), together with a DQN, reaching results significantly better than with only the standard DQN method. The agent can reliably reach the end of a maze, even when spawning in a random room. The agent is also able to properly shoot incoming enemies.
